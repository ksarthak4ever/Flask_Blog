# Flask_Blog
This is a Blog Application made using Flask. In this you can use read blogs and you can write,delete,update blogs by registering yourself and then logging in as a user.After logging in an account page would become available to access in which you can change your account details such as Username,Email address or your Profile picture.


I have put all the commands for the libraries used in making this application in the libraries.sh shell script which you can execute by running :~ $ ./libraries.sh   in the terminal and it would install flask and all the libraries such as sqlalchemy,wtf,login etc so you dont have to install all the libraries one by one.


To launch the application simply open the terminal and enter:~ $ python3 run.py
